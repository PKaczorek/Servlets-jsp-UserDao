# Servlets-jsp-UserDao
UserDao page made with use of Servlets and jsp

To this project I've used sb-admin-2 template, to be more pleasant to the eye.
On whole app we have sidebar with "ADMIN' written in it, which takes us to the main page in this case it's user list. In the future it could be link to "About", where Potential customer will be able, to know some more about our company.
This user dao lets you:
-View list of users where you.
-Check user details (User ID, User Name and User E-mail), in this option we also have a button that will take us back to the user list.
-Edit user details such as: User name, E-mail and password which is hashed while typing in so no one could see our users password. Ofcourse after typing our new details, we have to press Save to send edited data to database. In this option we also have a button that will take us back to the user list.
-Delete function which with just one click will erase our user from the list.
-Add User(button in top-right corner), in which app will ask us for Username, Email and password(Hashed). All the details are REQUIRED to be able to add new user to our Database. In this option we also have a button that will take us back to the user list.
